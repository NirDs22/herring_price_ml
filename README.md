# Herring Price Regression

Using ML regression models to predict herring price

This project implements data cleaning, preprocessing and analysis to train & test regression models
on herring price dataset. The results were submitted to my professor and won 1st place.
Demonstrates: Data cleaning, handeling outliers, completing missing values, evaluating ML models and feature importance. 

## Project Goals

- Explore the different attributes of very active users vs "regular" users
- Explore the text, narrative and rating data from Yelp reviews
- Apply text preprocessing and feature extraction (TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.)
- Perform clustering to discover groups of similar reviews/users
- Visualize key findings with graphs and word clouds

## Main Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

- Identified main words and patterns for each users group
- Found "noise" reviews with unique words
- Clustering revealed high textual diversity and challenge in distinguishing user groups based only on text
- Presented visualizations to summarize key insights

## Files

- `notebooks/herring_price_ml.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with all analysis steps
- `data/` – data files
- `reports/` – Work report

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `notebooks/herring_price_ml.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells
