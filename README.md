# Herring Price Regression

Using ML regression models to predict herring prices

This project applies data cleaning, preprocessing and analysis to train & test regression models
on a herring prices dataset. The results were submitted as a class assignment and won 1st place.
Demonstrates: Data cleaning, handling outliers, filling missing values, evaluating ML models, and analyzing feature importance. 

## Project Goals

- Properly clean and preprocess the data for training and testing ML models.
- Predict herring prices using numerical and categorical features, comparing several regression algorithms.

## Main Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

- Successfully predicted herring prices with MAE = 8.5

## Files

- `notebooks/herring_price_ml.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with all analysis steps
- `data/` – data files
- `reports/` – Project report

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `notebooks/herring_price_ml.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells
